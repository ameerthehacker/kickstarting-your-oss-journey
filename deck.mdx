### Kickstarting your OSS Journey 🎤

# What is OSS 🤷‍♂
---

## Bill Gates Open Letter

> "As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software.
> Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?"

> \- Bill Gates

## We hackers are Rebels 🙂
